Abscess | A local accumulation of pus anywhere in the body.
PostSurgicalScar | Scar tissue forms as part of the healing process after a skin injury. A scar is fibrous tissue made of collagen that replaces the injured skin.
PathologicalLymphNode | Localized adenopathy should prompt a search for an adjacent precipitating lesion and an examination of other nodal areas to rule out generalized lymphadenopathy. In general, lymph nodes greater than 1 cm in diameter are considered to be abnormal. Supraclavicular nodes are the most worrisome for malignancy.
Nodule | A small collection of tissue that is palpable (can be felt) at any level of the skin (in the epidermis, dermis, or subcutis) or in another tissue of the body.
Node | Node: Literally a knot, a node is a collection of tissue. For example a lymph node, is a collection of lymphoid tissue. A nodule is a small node, a little collection of tissue.
MastitisArea | Mastitis is an inflammation of breast tissue that sometimes involves an infection. The inflammation results in breast pain, swelling, warmth and redness. ... Mastitis most commonly affects women who are breast-feeding (lactation mastitis). But mastitis can occur in women who aren't breast-feeding and in men.
Mass | A lump in the body. It may be caused by the abnormal growth of cells, a cyst, hormonal changes, or an immune reaction.
Lipoma | A lipoma is a slow-growing, fatty lump that's most often situated between your skin and the underlying muscle layer.
Hematoma | A breast hematoma is a collection of blood that forms under the skin's surface. It's not unlike having a large bruise in your breast. The mass it forms is not cancerous, but it can sometimes lead to inflammation, fever, skin discoloration, and may leave behind scar tissue that mimics the shape of a breast tumor.
Hamartoma | A hamartoma is a mostly benign, focal malformation that resembles a neoplasm in the tissue of its origin.
ForeignBody | A foreign object is something that is in the body but doesn't belong there.
FluidCollection | A mild buildup of fluid is common after surgery and does not necessarily mean a seroma will appear.
FibrocysticTissue | Fibrocystic breast changes lead to the development of fluid-filled round or oval sacs (cysts) and more prominent scar-like (fibrous) tissue, which can make breasts feel tender, lumpy or ropy.
FibroadenomaDegeneration | Predominant cystic degeneration of the tumor that grossly constitutes most of the tumor, so called{% endcapture %}{{ md_text | markdownify }}</td>

DensityFocalAsymmetry | By definition, a focal asymmetric density is seen on two mammographic views but cannot be accurately identified as a true mass (,,,Fig 4).

AngularMargin | An 'angular margin' is simply a pronounced 'angled-off' projection from the mass. Any kind of irregular or jagged projection at the margin is suspcious of malignancy.
CircumscribedMargin | At least 75%% of the margin is sharply demarcated, with an abrupt transition between the lesion and surrounding tissue.
IndistinctMargin | No clear demarcation of the entire margin or any portion of it from the surrounding tissue.
IntraductalExtension | Intraductal tumor extension is a characteristic feature of primary breast carcinoma, and is an important consideration in patients undergoing breast conservative surgery. However, there have been no reports of studies of intraductal extension within the mammary ductal tree.
IrregularMargin | Circumscribed oval and round masses are usually benign. An irregular shape suggests a greater likelihood of malignancy. The margins can be described as circumscribed, microlobulated, obscured (partially hidden by adjacent tissue), indistinct (ill-defined), or spiculated (characterized by lines radiating from the mass).
LobulatedMargin | The margin of the lesion reflects the demarcation of the mass with surrounding tissue. It can be smooth, micro lobulated, irregular or spiculated. Gentle bilobulate or Tri lobulated margins are considered smooth.
MacrolobulatedMargin | MacrolobulatedMargin
MicrolobulatedMargin | A margin characterized by short-cycle undulations.
NonCircumscribedMargin | NonCircumscribedMargin
ObscuredMargin | ObscuredMargin
SmoothMargin | Smooth: A benign lesion usually has clear and smooth margin, which is well defined with the surrounding breast tissues. ... Similar to mammography, some early breast cancer with small foci can presents benign appearance even under high-resolution MRI.

SkinMass | It typically has an irregular shape, and it may feel as if it is stuck to the skin or deep tissue within the breast.
SolidMass | Approximately 90%% of palpable breast masses (masses that can be felt) are benign and are not cancer. The most common cause of a breast mass is fibrocystic or normal tissue.

EnlargedNode | When cancer has spread to the axillary lymph nodes, the nodes may feel enlarged, or there may be a noticeable lump.

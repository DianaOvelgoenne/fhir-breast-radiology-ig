Establishing the location and type of landmark using a body site code and optional laterality/orientation, and\n2. Specifying the direction and distance from the landmark to the body location.\nNote that BodyLocation is a data type, a reusable structure, not a stand-alone entity. The concept is similar to how a postal address can apply to a person, location, or organization. This contrasts with FHIR's stand-alone BodySite (aka BodyStructure in r4) which 'is not ... intended for describing the type of anatomical location but rather a specific body site on a specific patient' (FHIR 3.5).",

Establishing the location and type of landmark using a body site code and optional laterality/orientation, and\n2. Specifying the direction and distance from the landmark to the body location.\nNote that BodyLocation is a data type, a reusable structure, not a stand-alone entity. The concept is similar to how a postal address can apply to a person, location, or organization. This contrasts with FHIR's stand-alone BodySite (aka BodyStructure in r4) which 'is not ... intended for describing the type of anatomical location but rather a specific body site on a specific patient' (FHIR 3.5).",
